# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Budget Travel aims to make a simple and efficient road trip planning process for users by providing an understandable interface that helps walk them through the process. Through Budget Travel, users can  arrange road trips, plan stops during their road trips, hotel accommodations, book flights, and plan activities within one platform. The creation and design of our prototypes are based on the wireframes that we created to provide users with a comprehensive visualization of the application's layout and functionality, offering a preview of the user experience before the final product is accessible, thus enhancing their comprehension of its functionality. 

## Methods

### Pilot Test


### Usability Testing:

Our Usability test or main objectives were to make Budget Travel users have a memorable experience that differs from other vacation planning websites. Our usability testing was designed to focus on our user interaction, preferences, and expectations. By understanding the needs of our diverse user base, encompassing individuals with varied budget constraints, travel experiences, technological proficiency, and distinct travel motivations, we sought to enhance the user journey through Budget Travel's interface. We decided to focus on some specific screening.

#### Screening
People who are a good fit:

* People who have a strict budget
* People who have no budget, but would like to save money
* People who are 18+ years old
* People who have never gone on vacation 
* People who travel day to day for business work looking for cheap travel prices
* People who have gone on multiple vacations (experienced travelers)
* People who want to keep track of the flights, hotel stays, and activities they have gone to as well as their ratings (public or private)
* People who want suggestions on what activities they could do and what’s going on during their stay I.e. concerts, park festivals/events, etc.
* People who don’t use technology often
* If budget travel is simple enough for them to understand, then others who are more versed with technology will likely have an easier time understanding what to do

We also decided to use the Think-aloud protocol in our Unit testing to provide us a better guidance on what the user is thinking and how they move through the application to be able to figure out where they struggle to move to the next step that causes them not to finish the tasks. 

##### - Think-aloud protocol
* By having a user verbally go through the steps they take, they may give information that they wouldn’t otherwise think about
* Such as their expectations
* What they are looking for (“I want to find the filter button”)
* Their reasonings (“I want to edit my trip, so I’m going to my profile to see my recent history.”)

Our Protocol was created to follow 3 different tasks. We made our prototypes to be interactive to allow the user to click and imagine what they were using for the finished product. For the usability test, we also asked the participants to "Think Aloud" to give us an idea of what they are thinking when interacting with the prototype and where they get confused or stuck.

#### Task 1
We would like you to imagine you already have an account created with us so you log in to your account. Your family wants to plan a road trip to Disneyland Adventure in Los Angeles. So you create a new Road Trip To Disney and you have a certain amount of money saved for the trip but on your drive there you want to make some stops to rest, eat, and visit. After you add your budget and you finished make sure you save all of your Road Trip information. Remember to speak out loud and walk me through how you would create that new trip to Disneyland with your family with a certain budget and how you choose your selected stops.

For **Task 1** what we were looking for was to see how the user moved through the application to be able to complete and create a new Road Trip add a Budget, add a final destination, and be able to add certain stops to their Road Trip.

#### Task 2
We would like you to now go into the saved trips you have in your account you want to change the number of people that are going and you also want to change the budget after adding more people. You also want to change your destination by choosing a different endpoint and then change or keep your same stops. We would also like you to speak out loud and walk me through the ways you move through the prototype to accomplish the task.

For **Task 2** we wanted to see the user use the editing tools where they could change any saved trip whether it's changing their Budget, trip title, people traveling, end destination, and stops.

#### Task 3
We would like you to log out of your account and act like you forgot your password. Speak out loud and walk me through the ways you move through the prototype to accomplish the task.

For **Task 3** we wanted to see the users interact with the forgot password function to see how they might struggle if they were ever needed to recover their account when they forgot their password.

## Findings

After running the **Usability Tests** we got feedback from (n = 6) participants with a rating of how difficult each task was 1 being difficult and 5 being easy. When gathering all of the ratings given by each participant we were able to insert them into a graph that allowed us to see the ratings from each participant for all of the 3 tasks with all of the participants giving them a rating of 5. We were happy with our results being able to see that all of the participants didn't struggle in a single task and were satisfied with the prototype.

## Conclusions

We found that many of our pilot testers said that our design was straightforward and followed traditional layouts making it very learnable and effective. In conclusion, our prototype is learnable and effective to those who have had experience with technology. It is recommended that we find users that are more diverse in background  rather than strictly usability engineering Chico State students.

## Caveats

Our limitations would be that we do not have a variety of demographics due to the fact that we were doing pilot testing with other students of California State University, Chico within the Usability Engineering class. We believe that everyone in the class had some experience or exposure to electronics or technology making our prototype accessible only to those with those experiences.
