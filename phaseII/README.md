# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Budget Travel is meant to help simplify its usersâ€™ trip-planning experience by providing an easy-to-understand interface that helps walk them through the process. With Budget Travel, users can make hotel reservations, book flights, and plan activities all in one place. By creating and designning wireframes that will help users get an idea of what our application will look like and give them a sence of how it will work with out having the finished product available in their hand.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

**Cognitive Walkthrough:** What we learned from the Cognitive Walkthrough is that a user would like to maybe filter the options available by their budget, and we thought that that was a good idea to implement to our wireframe and would help all of our users. Something we also learned was that maybe adding an average cost of a meal at a restaurant will work with the users budget. Also showing the current or changed Budget. Although our feedback mentioned that there is no login page shown, we felt that it was not necessary to add since we already have a wireframe for logging in. 

**Informal Feedback:**


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

From the **Cognitive Walkthrough** some findings were that users' might have some confusion on what to do next when they are creating/editing a trip them will become confused and might just press different buttons since they don"t know what is the next step or what to do next. The confusion could also lead for the users to simply go to to home screen and go back in a loop where they keep getting confused on where to go next

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

Some new discoveries derived from the **Cognitive Walkthrough** and the findings is that users might want to see an average price range of a meal of a restaruant/fast food place to help decide if they are willing to waste enough with their budget. Other discoveries involved adding back buttons on next buttons to let the user know that they are able to go to a next step of go back a step to not cause any confusion of where to move to next to plan their trip. 

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
