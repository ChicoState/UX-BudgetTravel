# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Budget Travel aims to make a simple and efficient road trip planning process for users by providing an understandable interface that helps walk them through the process. Through Budget Travel, users can  arrange road trips, plan stops during their road trips, hotel accommodations, book flights, and plan activities within one platform. The creation and design of our prototypes are based on the wireframes that we created to provide users with a comprehensive visualization of the application's layout and functionality, offering a preview of the user experience before the final product is accessible, thus enhancing their comprehension of its functionality.
