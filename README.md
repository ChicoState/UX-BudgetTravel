# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Traveling the world may seem like an exciting and memorable experience, but what about the planning? With Budget Travel users can efficiently book flights, hotels, transportation, and activities with just a few clicks. We conducted research and analysis on different competitors to understand how best to meet usersâ€™ needs and how we can make their experience using Budget Travel stand out amongst similar products on the market. 
 - <u>Competitive analysis</u> of top competitors gave an overview of how best to serve users
      - Clear communication: Users express frustration when they cannot speak to a representative or have a way to resolve issues
      - History of transactions: Users expressed that bookings were not made even though payment was accepted. 
 - <u>Heuristic evaluation</u> of a top competitor found that an appealing design that draws the users' attention to important information/data can help users navigate through a website better
 - <u>Personas and scenarios</u> helped understand who potential users may be and why they would be interested in using Budget Travel:
      - Being able to plan a budget-friendly trip
      - Simplifying the trip-planning process
      - The ability to include how many people will go on a trip
      - Splitting costs among several users
- <u>Sketches</u> gave a rough idea of how the layout should be:
  <ul>
    <li>Separating bookings by type (hotel, transportation, flights, and activities)</li>
    <li>Search for bookings based on user input (location, people going, budget, proximity, and dates)</li>
    <li>Being upfront about pricing by including additional fees in the advertised price</li>
  </ul>
