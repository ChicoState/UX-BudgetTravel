# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Budget Travel aims to make a simple and efficient road trip planning process for users by providing an understandable interface that helps walk them through the process. Through Budget Travel, users can  arrange road trips, plan stops during their road trips, hotel accommodations, book flights, and plan activities within one platform. The creation and design of our prototypes are based on the wireframes that we created to provide users with a comprehensive visualization of the application's layout and functionality, offering a preview of the user experience before the final product is accessible, thus enhancing their comprehension of its functionality. 

## Methods

### Pilot Test

### Usability Testing:

#### Task 1
We would like you to imagine you already have an account created with us so you log in to your account. Your family wants to plan a road trip to Disneyland Adventure in Los Angeles. So you create a new Road Trip To Disney and you have a certain amount of money saved for the trip but on your drive there you want to make some stops to rest, eat, and visit. After adding your budget and you finished make sure you save all of your Road Trip information. Remember to speak out loud and walk me through how you would create that new trip to Disneyland with your family with a certain budget and how you choose your selected stops.

For **Task 1** what we were looking for was to see how the user moved through the application to be able to complete and create a new Road Trip add a Budget, add a final destination, and be able to add certain stops to their Road Trip.

#### Task 2
We would like you to now go into the saved trips you have in your account you want to change the number of people that are going and you also want to change the budget after adding more people. You also want to change your destination by choosing a different endpoint and then change or keep your same stops. We would also like you to speak out loud and walk me through the ways you move through the prototype to accomplish the task.

For **Task 2** we wanted to see the user use the editing tools where they could change any saved trip whether it's changing their Budget, trip title, people traveling, end destination, and stops.

#### Task 3
We would like you to log out of your account and act like you forgot your password. Speak out loud and walk me through the ways you move through the prototype to accomplish the task.

For **Task 3** we wanted to see the users interact with the forgot password function to see how they might struggle if they were ever needed to recover their account when they forgot their password.

## Findings

After running the **Usability Tests** we were able to get feedback from (n = 6) participants with a rating of how difficult each task was 1 being difficult and 5 being easy. When gathering all of the ratings given by each participant we were able to insert them into a graph that allowed us to see the ratings from each participant for all of the 3 tasks with all of the participants giving them a rating of 5. We were happy with our results being able to see that all of the participants didn't struggle in a single task and were satisfied with the prototype.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
