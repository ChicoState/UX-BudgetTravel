# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Traveling the world may seem like an exciting and memorable experience, but what about the planning? With Budget Travel users can efficiently book flights, hotels, transportation, and activities with just a few clicks. We conducted research and analysis on different competitors to understand how best to meet users’ needs and how we can make their experience using Budget Travel stand out amongst similar products on the market. 
 - <u>Competitive analysis</u> of top competitors gave an overview of how best to serve users
      - Clear communication: Users express frustration when they cannot speak to a representative or have a way to resolve issues
      - History of transactions: Users expressed that bookings were not made even though payment was accepted. 
 - <u>Heuristic evaluation</u> of a top competitor found that an appealing design that draws the users' attention to important information/data can help users navigate through a website better
 - <u>Personas and scenarios</u> helped understand who potential users may be and why they would be interested in using Budget Travel:
      - Being able to plan a budget-friendly trip
      - Simplifying the trip-planning process
      - The ability to include how many people will go on a trip
      - Splitting costs among several users
- <u>Sketches</u> gave a rough idea of how the layout should be:
  <ul>
    <li>Separating bookings by type (hotel, transportation, flights, and activities)</li>
    <li>Search for bookings based on user input (location, people going, budget, proximity, and dates)</li>
    <li>Being upfront about pricing by including additional fees in the advertised price</li>
  </ul>

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

* !!!In a bullet-list, provide a summary that highlights...!!!
* !!!What you've done during this phase...!!!
* !!!and what the significance of it is...!!!
* !!!as an executive would understand.!!!

- Used the sketches we created in Phase I to help model our wireframes 
<u>Wireframes</u> were created based on expected user interactions, which were used to guide the SE team and give a general idea of Budget Travel's capabilities. Our completed wireframes model the following interactions:
<ul>
    <li>User Login</li>
    <li>User Sign Up<li>
    <li>Flight Booking</li>
    <li>Checking For Nearby Restaurants</li>
    <li>Adding a Budget</li>
    <li>Creating/Editing Trips</li>
</ul>
<u>Cognitive walkthroughs</u> were conducted with the help of two classmates. They were given a description of our persona “John” and an accompanying scenario “The Family Trip” to better understand the purpose of our wireframe. Our classmates were meant to act as “John” and attempt to complete the task “search for nearby restaurants”. Once our classmates completed their tasks, they provided feedback based on each step they took. Based on the feedback we received, we concluded that:
<ul>
 <li> Users want to filter options by their specified budget, not just price</li>
 <li>We should clarify what interactions our wireframes are modeled after</li>
 <li>The user's budget should be visible and easy to access</li>
</ul>
The SE team presented what they created and received <u>Informal Feedback</u>, which let us know what else we can implement into Budget Travel (and possible wireframes to create) as well as how to better the users' experience
<ul>
 <li>Features to add</li>
 <ul>
  <li>available activity</li>
  <li>destinations</li>
  <li>other user activity</li>
  <li>breakdown activities based on the budget</li>
  <li><strong>create trips</strong></li>
 </ul>
 <li>Ideas to discard</li>
 <ul>
  <li> Do not put a sales pitch on the launch page</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
