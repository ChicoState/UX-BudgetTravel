# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve !!!

## Methods

<!--!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!! -->

**Competitive Analysis** by conducting research on competitors (such as Travelocity, Trivago, TravelSpend, TripCoin, Hotels, and Tricount). The main purpose of a competitive analysis is to know more about the leading competitors, such as their strengths, weaknesses, and quality. The findings of a Competitive Analysis help when deciding what features to offer or any additional improvements that can be made. In addition, Competitive Analysis helps find areas where competitors may be lacking. For our Competitive Analysis, we recorded what the competitors' strengths and weaknesses were, such as layout, aesthetics, trustworthiness, ease of navigation, price, customer service, services offered, platform, and overall quality. Reading customer reviews can also be beneficial since users are giving feedback based on their experience.

**Heuristic Evaluation** where one competitor is further evaluated to see how well it can accomplish a specific user goal. The primary purpose of a Heuristic Evaluation is to see how well a product’s design is and how well users understand it. Heuristic Evaluations find potential problems for users and can help improve the user’s experience.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
