# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

Budget Travel is meant to help simplify its users’ trip-planning experience by providing an easy-to-understand interface that helps walk them through the process. With Budget Travel, users can make hotel reservations, book flights, and plan activities all in one place. By creating and designing wireframes, we can give users a general idea of what our application will look like and give them a better understanding of how it will work, even without having the finished product available in their hand.

## Methods

!!! Describe the research methods you used to discover new insights and explain the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

**Cognitive Walkthrough:** 
For our research method, we got a fellow UX designer to conduct a cognitive walkthrough on one of our wireframes. The wireframe we decided to get feedback on was “Find Nearby Restaurants”. We included our persona “John” and a scenario to help the UX designer get a  better understanding of what interaction the wireframe is meant to encapsulate. The cognitive walkthrough was done to get feedback on how we can improve our wireframes and Budget Travel’s overall design in order to minimize confusion and give users a better experience. 

What we learned from the Cognitive Walkthrough is users likely want to filter available options by their budget. As such, we decided to create a filtering button in our wireframes which would help all of our users. Something we also learned was that maybe adding an average cost of a meal at a restaurant will work with the user's budget. Also showing the current or changed Budget. Although our feedback mentioned that there is no login page shown, we felt that it was not necessary to add since we already have a wireframe for logging in. 

**Informal Feedback:**
The SE team presented what they created based on the UX Team's sketches, wireframes, and general ideas for Budget Travel. After both the UX and SE teams met up, the SE team explained the feedback they received:
   - <strong>Create Roadtrips</strong>
       - The market is already saturated with different booking apps (such as Expedia, Travelocity, etc) therefore "Roadtrips" will help Budget Travel stand out
       - With Roadtrips, users can pick their destination and budget
       - similar to actual road trips, users can select certain spots along the way to their destination, and plan activities based on those locations
   - Budgets
     - Users want to be able to filter activities based on their budget
   - Activity
     - Users want to view their previous activity (similar to "recent history")
     - Users want to see other users' activity
        - This is similar to a "Trending" or "Popular" tab
        - This gives a general sense of what is a popular choice, which can influence users
   - Launch Page
     - Users do not want to see a sales pitch when they first open up the app
     - A login or sign-up page should be the first screen a user sees
        - This can help limit confusion by giving users an immediate action to complete

## Findings

From the **Cognitive Walkthrough** some findings were that users' might have some confusion on what to do next when they are creating/editing a trip them will become confused and might just press different buttons since they don"t know what is the next step or what to do next. The confusion could also lead for the users to simply go to to home screen and go back in a loop where they keep getting confused on where to go next

From the **Informal Feedback** some findings were that users highlighted a need for a Roadtips feature which could differentiate Budget Travel from other saturated booking apps. With this feature, users can select their destination and budget, similar to planning a road trip. They should also have the ability to choose specific stops along the way and plan activities based on those locations. A second finding is that users expressed the desire to filter activities based on their budget. This finding let us know that we need to incorporate budget related features in our design. Other findings involved the avtiviy where the users were interest in seeing other users' activity, which would be categorized as a "Trending" or "Popular" trips tab where the user would be able to see popular choices from other users. The las finding envolved the launch page where users preferred not to see a sales pitch when first opening the app and they suggested having a login or sign-up page as the initial screen to reduce confusion and provide users with a clear next step action.

## Conclusions

Some new discoveries derived from the **Cognitive Walkthrough** and the findings is that users might want to see an average price range of a meal of a restaruant/fast food place to help decide if they are willing to waste enough with their budget. Other discoveries involved adding back buttons on next buttons to let the user know that they are able to go to a next step of go back a step to not cause any confusion of where to move to next to plan their trip.

Some new discoveries derived from the **Informal Feedback** is that the desire to see other users' activities and trending or popular trips points to the importance of user-generated content. Encourage users to share their trip plans, reviews, and recommendations. Design features that allow users to contribute their experiences and insights, creating some type of community and trust within the app. To enhance user engagement and satisfaction we need to improve the overall user experience, consider introducing personalization features. The preference for a login or sign-up page over a sales pitch lets us know the importance of a seamless onboarding process and we will need to modify our design where we focus on ensuring a straightforward path to creating an account and getting started.

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
